            <h2 class="h">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
             <h3 class="h">What is a cryptocollectible?</h3>
             <p>All the official Darkwinds cards are crypto collectibles: They are created as a special asset in the Ethereum Blockchain. This means it's completely yours to use, trade or sell anywhere. 
             </p>
             <br>
             <h3 class="h">How many types of cards exist?</h3>
             <p>There are 100 different cards that can be obtained at random through the "First Edition" smart contract. </p>

             <p>Very soon, we will release expansions with new contracts with card model #101 and up. </p>
             <p>You can see all the 100 initial cards <a href="https://playdarkwinds.com/cards.html">here</a>.</p>
             <br>
             <h3 class="h">How are cards generated at random?</h3>
             <p>For every new card in circulation, a Smart Contract transaction will generate one from the 100 models at random.</p>
             <p>The contract is coded in a way that makes some cards more common than others. </p>
             <p>If you are curious, you can look at the source code in <a href="https://github.com/megoforce/darkwinds/tree/master/contracts">our GitHub</a>.</p>
             <br>
             <h3 class="h">What are the system requirements for Darkwinds?</h3>
             <p>You can play on Windows, MacOS and Linux with your browser and the Metamask extension.</p>
             <p>MetaMask allows you to run websites with Ethereum in your browser. Install it ONLY through its official website <a target="_blank" href="https://metamask.io/">here</a>.</p>
             <br>
             <h3 class="h">How are my Darkwinds cards secured?</h3>
             <p>The Metamask extension generates a private key locally on your computer and it's stored secret with your Password. This means you are the only one with access to them. Users are responsible for backup of their wallets.</p>
             <p>Thankfully, Metamask wallets are easy to back-up with a mnemonic recovery phase. Remember to save your mnemonic somewhere safe. We are not responsible for losts, neither MetaMask. </p>
             <br>
             
             <h3 class="h">How do I get ETH?</h3>

             <h3 class="h">Where can I check my ETH balance?</h3>
             <p>If you already transferred ETH to you MetaMask wallet, check your balance. MetaMask will appear in your browser.  If you have at least 0.01 Ethereum you are ready.</p>
