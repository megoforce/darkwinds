                <p style="margin-top: 30px;">Not all cards are created equal. Half of the 100-card set appear more frequently, which makes the latter half rarer. A rarer card will most of the times be more powerful than its more frequent counterpart, and the characters depicted have a more important role in the game's lore.</p>
