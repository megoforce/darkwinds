The best that can happen to you if you open a Darkwinds pack is scoring rare card. For decades TCGs have been printing a limited amount of some of their models to be coveted by collectors. When card games went digital and the cards exist in a database, rarity can be controlled very fast and it's hard to understand how it happens.

## In the Blockchain age, we can do better

We can write the rules of issuance in a smart contract, guaranteeing every purchaser a transparent chance of obtaining a rare card. 

When a Darkwinds booster chest is purchased all the card models are determined by a pseudo-random number that will only produce rare cards above a treshold.

When publishing the contract also made sure it's impossible to change the rules.

There can only be 1 million Darkwinds First Edition cards of 100 diferent models. So there are many to be created, but there's a 90% chance that will be one of the first 50 models, so the other half is considered Rare.

Of the 50 rare card models, we call the last 20 ultra-rare because they are even more unlikely to appear. At the time of this writing there are 6 models that have never appeared.

You can distinguish your cards rarity by looking at the border color.
