## Choose your style
To understand how to build a good deck, it's important to think on how you will try to win. During our game design process we spent countless hours to make sure there's more than one way to win, and they are:

* Power: In the current ruleset, some cards have more attack and defense points. There's great reward in finding them and using them in combination.
* Strategy: Use cards that will confuse the opponent and make bad desicions. Try to anticipate to the enemy and get ahead of their turn
* Statistics: Learn the most used cards, discover if there is a popular meta and build the pefect counter-deck. Make sure your win rate is positive and your deck is effective against the dominant strategy.

You can also combine two, or all the different styles. There's even perhaps a fourth one that we didn't plan out for. Will you be able to discover it?

## Deck Testing
It's very important to try different variants of your deck and play against other opponents with different decks and strategies to learn about your strong and weak points of every card and the correct way to combine them in one turn.

The best way to do it is in the *Quick Match* mode of the game, where you only gain experience but your skill rating is not modified. There's also other people testing decks so you'll find a greater variesty of escenarios to learn from.

Is you see enough times an enemy card that destroys your strategy, look for the one that counters it.

## Weigh in the Luck factor
Dont overlook the luck factor. Sometimes you're out of luck and your oponent might have the best hand of their life. If you lose, it doesn't always mean your deck sucks. Consider giving it another chance.

## Look in the market for your missing card
If the only thing missing from your dream deck is a specific card, remember that the magic of NFTs is that you can trade them outside the game. You can look for a specific card and buy it in <a href="https://opensea.io/category/darkwinds">the Darkwinds marketplace</a>.

Good luck. You will need it!
