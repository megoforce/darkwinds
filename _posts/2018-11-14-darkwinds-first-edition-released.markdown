**Darkwinds is officially live.**

After an intense first year of development, we're happy to announce that we've achieved our initial goal: build a fully-featured trading card game on Ethereum with multiplayer matchmaking and competitive leaderboards, thus, no longer in beta (yayyy!).

In this "First Edition", players will uncover the story of [Princess Eleanor](https://playdarkwinds.com/lore/2018/10/12/princess-eleanor.html), who is navigating the seas on the quest to find her father, King Enrique IX de Itova, after he dissappeard in the middle of a black magic storm. Ever since, forgotten pirates, powerful sorcerers and giant creatures have come to conquer the biggest of Thard's kingdoms. 

## Aye aye!!!

With Darkwinds we attempt to honor classic trading card games, and transport players to an exotic world such as a sea of pirates where honor, madness, rum and luck rules. We introduced a small and ruleset for an "easy to learn, hard to master" experience.

## Publishing of the final First Edition cards

We created and designed 100 unique game cards acquirable through our smart contract.

As of today all the properties and abilities of cards are final. It means **we won't be changing the attack rates, spells, health or cost**.

As we are commited to the concept of immutable cryptocollectibles, we're extending our smart contracts to include such info, so all Darkwinds cards ever bought will stay the same and nobody can nerf.

Most of the cards were re imagined with stunning artwork from more than 20 artists.

Today you can buy all Darkwinds First Edition packs and random cards with Ethereum.

## Gameplay improvements

The current version of the game has many bugfixes and suggestions from players included.

-Our bot Lord Cochrane a bit wiser (sorry).<br><br>
-Best strategies are rewarded in Competitive match.  It is calculated using the [TrueSkill](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/trueskill-ranking-system/) system.<br><br>


## Performance
-Faster graphic engine and new interface.<br><br>
-Stable game experience.
