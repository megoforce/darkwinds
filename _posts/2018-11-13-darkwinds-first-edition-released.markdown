Darkwinds is officially live.

After an intense first year of development, we are happy to inform you that we have achieved our initial goal of building a fully-featured 
trading card game on Ethereum with multiplayer matchmaking and competitive leaderboards, thus, no longer in beta. 

We also created and designed 100 unique game cards acquirable through our smart contract.

In this "First Edition", players will uncover the story of Princess Eleanor, who is navigating the seas on the quest to find her father, King Enrique IX de Itova, after he dissappeard in the middle of a black magic storm. Ever since, forgotten pirates, powerful sorcerers and giant creatures have come to conquer the bigest of Thard's kingdoms. 

With Darkwinds we attempt to honor classic trading card games while at the same time transport players to an exotic world such as a sea of pirates where honor, madness, rum and luck are the key for survival. We introduced a small but deep ruleset for an "easy to learn, hard to master" experience.

## Final card design

As of today all the properties and abilities of cards are final. Which means we won't be changing the attack rates, spells, health or cost. And since we are commited to the concept of immutable cryptocollectibles, we are extending our smart contracts to include such info, so all Darkwinds cards ever bought will stay the same and nobody can nerf.

Also, most of the cards were re imagined with stunning artwork from more than 20 artists.

## Build your deck
You can buy Darkwinds, first edition cards today using Ethereum and Metamask.

## What to expect next
We already have plans for second edition and expansions with added rules to the base game, which we'll discuss in a future post. Meanwhile, we are eager to hear your opinions, ideas and frustrations, so don't forget to <a href="https://discord.gg/WwyCERC">join us on discord</a>.
