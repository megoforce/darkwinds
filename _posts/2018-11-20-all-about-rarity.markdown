One of the best things of being a card collector is to get rare cards. And for decades TCG games have been printing a limited amount of some to make them coveted by collectors.

In traditional physical trading card games, rarity meant that the company was printing a rare card every a bigger number of normal ones. When card games became digital and the cards are created as a number of a database rarity is an ever changing mechanic that fine tuned by the developers.

## In the Blockchain age, we can do better

We can write the rules of issuance in a smart contract, guaranteeing every purchaser a transparent chance of obtaining a rare card. 

When a Darkwinds booster chest is purchased all the card models are determined by a pseudo-random number that will only produce rare cards above a treshold.

If you are into technical details you can look at <a href="/whitepaper/darkwinds.pdf">our whitepaper</a>

When publishing the contract also made sure it's impossible to change the rules.

There can only be 1 million Darkwinds First Edition cards of 100 diferent models. So there are many to be created, but there's a 90% chance that will be one of the first 50 models, so the other half is considered Rare.

Of the 50 rare card models, we consider 20 to be ultra-rare because they are even more unlikely to appear. At the time of this writing there are 6 models that have never appeared.

We assign rarity in 3 ties: Ruby (Not Rare), Gold (Rare), Diamond (Very Rare)

You can distinguish your cards rarity by looking at the border color.
